This directory contains the templates used in the Linux Driver Workshops
Many of them are w.r.t. the custom hardware LDD Kit. For version compatibility,
look into the file VERSIONS.

You may compile these templates by typing make in the toplevel folder or
individual folders after setting the KERNEL_SOURCE variable to your kernel's
source directory in the top-level Makefile & module.mk
