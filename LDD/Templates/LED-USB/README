This directory contains the USB UCTL driver.
To compile edit the Makefile to point to the correct KERNEL SOURCE path.

In Ubuntu you can install Kernel header by running:
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`

KERNEL_SOURCE should be /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`

Steps to follow:
----------------
1. Flash the necessary firmware into the device (LED, LCD, SSD, or USB to Serial) hex files.
2. Remove cdc_acm driver. This driver gets loaded automatically
sudo rmmod cdc_acm
3.  Load the USB LED driver:
sudo insmod led-usb.ko
4. Do a dmesg and check whether probe is getting called. Plus check whether /dev/uctl0 is created. If yes the driver has detected the device and it is ready to use.
5. sudo echo led-on > /dev/uctl0
